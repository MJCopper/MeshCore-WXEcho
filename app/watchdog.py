"""Liveness watchdog.

`restart: unless-stopped` (Docker) and `Restart=on-failure` (systemd) relaunch a
process that CRASHES, but not one that is wedged-but-alive: a deadlock or a sync
call blocking the asyncio event loop leaves the process "running" while it quietly
stops polling BOM and stops transmitting. This watchdog catches that.

A plain OS thread (independent of the event loop, so it keeps running even when
the loop is blocked) checks a heartbeat that an event-loop task refreshes. If the
loop stops refreshing it for `stall_seconds`, the loop is wedged, so we force-exit
non-zero and let the restart policy bring up a healthy instance.
